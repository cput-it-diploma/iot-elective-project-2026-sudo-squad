## 💡 Project Idea & Problem Statement

### Problem Statement
Using paper sign-in sheets or physical roll calls to track student attendance is ineffective, takes up important lecture time, and is very vulnerable to proxy-signing, or buddy-punching. Furthermore, instructors are unable to see the capacity of the venue in real time (tailgating). Additionally, academic institutions find it difficult to confirm a student's actual presence on campus for high-stakes tests due to the rise of remote and hybrid assessments, which makes assessment fraud more likely.

### Proposed Solution
An Arduino-based 4-sensor array powers Sudo-Scan, an automated digital attendance kiosk. Students utilize an RFID reader to check in using their current 13.56MHz student cards. The gadget has an anti-tailgating body counter (IR Obstacle sensor), a check-in/out mode toggle (Touch sensor), and an environmentally friendly "wake-up" mode (Ultrasonic sensor).

The system's "Strict Exam Mode" for invigilators is crucial. The system quickly grants or denies entrance and verifies the student's physical attendance for the test by requiring a physical RFID tap at the venue door and cross-referencing the student's UID with a secure exam roster database.

### Objectives
- [ ] Objective 1 : Automate student check-ins using RFID technology to eliminate manual paper registers.
- [ ] Objective 2 : Detect and flag venue "tailgating" by comparing successful RFID scans with physical body counts via an IR obstacle sensor.
- [ ] Objective 3 : Transmit all attendance data in real-time to a Spring Boot/MySQL backend and display it on a React.js lecturer dashboard.
- [ ] Objective 4 : Implement a "Strict Exam Mode" to verify a student's physical presence on campus, cross-referencing RFID scans against secure exam rosters to prevent remote assessment fraud.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Design

![System Architecture Diagram](images/architecture_diagram.png)

### Design Decisions
Microcontroller Selection: To guarantee minimal power consumption, rigorous adherence to the project brief, and extremely responsive low-level C++ sensor control, we chose the Arduino Uno R3 over a Linux-based SBC (such as a Raspberry Pi).

Software Stack Pivot: Instead of using a complex Java Spring Boot architecture, we opted for a lightweight Python (Flask) and SQLite backend. For basic IoT data logging, this micro-framework method is far more effective and guarantees quick HTTP response times for the Arduino.

Hardware User Experience: We steered clear of intricate biometric sensors that result in bottlenecks in serial communication. To enable users to interact with the device statuses (Check-In, Check-Out, and Exam Mode), we instead implemented a touch sensor.
